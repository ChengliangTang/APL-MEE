### Data/labels folder

This folder contains the processed ground label data. According to the projection information, we transform the stem locations in terms of EPSG coordinates into pixel-wise row/column index, e.g., pix_1 = 20, pix_2 = 50 ==> corresponding pixel location = (50, 20) of data/images/LFDP.jpg.

#### Important variables

SPECIES: tree species

DIAM: diameter at breast height (DBH)

pix_1: column index of the stem location

pix_2: row index of the stem location
